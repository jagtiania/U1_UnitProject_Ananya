# Starry Night 
<h2> Description </h2>
This code is a piece of art where the starry night is trying to be shown. The shapes and colors used clearly show what kind of a painting this is. 
<h2> Inspiration </h2>
I was inspired to create the starry night when I was thinking about what makes me happy and relaxed. I then brainstormed diffrent ideas of things that I like and it turned out being nature and stars so I decided to do something with stars. Then I thought of what makes me feel relazed and to me it is looking at stars and just thinking about life. Therefore by making this project, I am able to just play my code and feel relaxed because I can look at twinkling stars. 
<h2> Screenshots </h2>
day 1: http://imgur.com/a/gvFOj I managed to create the shape but they wouldn't move instead it was all just in one line 
day 2: http://imgur.com/a/svZKt the stars started moving a little bit but then they would take a lot of time to move from place to place and i removed the border of the star 
day 3: http://imgur.com/a/0gvAj this was the initial size of the shape and i managed to get all of the stars to decrease
day 4: http://imgur.com/a/0j39t after getting the stars to decrease its shape, they started twinkling which is what my final goal was
