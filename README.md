# Starry Night 
<h2> Description </h2>
This code is a piece of art where the starry night is trying to be shown. The shapes and colors used clearly show what kind of a painting this is. 
<h2> Inspiration </h2>
I was inspired to create the starry night when I was thinking about what makes me happy and relaxed. I then brainstormed diffrent ideas of things that I like and it turned out being nature and stars so I decided to do something with stars. Then I thought of what makes me feel relazed and to me it is looking at stars and just thinking about life. Therefore by making this project, I am able to just play my code and feel relaxed because I can look at twinkling stars.
